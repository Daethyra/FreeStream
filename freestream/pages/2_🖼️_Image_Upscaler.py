    Although the page is still being worked on, you're encouraged to test out the current upscaler, [Swin2SR](https://huggingface.co/caidas/swin2SR-classical-sr-x2-64).
    
    Images with a width *or* height greater than 1024 will be downsampled by a factor of 2. This limitation will be removed when a more robust solution is finished.
    
    As with all FreeStream pages, this one's purpose is merely to show you the possibilities without having to sign up or program anything manually.
