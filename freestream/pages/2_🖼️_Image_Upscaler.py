    Although the page is still being worked on, you're encouraged to test out the current upscaler, [Swin2SR](https://huggingface.co/caidas/swin2SR-classical-sr-x2-64).
    
    **Limitations**:
    
    * Images with a width *or* height greater than 512 will be downsampled by a factor of 2. This limitation will be removed when a more robust solution is finished.
    * The current upscaler problematically generates new content around the edge of the image, especially on the right side. However, because the upscaled image retains the center content, the excess content can easily be cropped. Also, since the underlying upscale model is planned for replacement, this is not a main concern.
    
    As with all FreeStream pages, this one's purpose is merely to show you the possibilities without having to sign up or program anything manually.
