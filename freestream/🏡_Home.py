    :orange[*FreeStream's RAGbot can answer your questions directly from the documents you provide.*]
    
    It works by allowing you to upload PDFs, Word documents, or plain text files, and then ask specific questions based on the information in your documents. The RAGbot uses a method called Corrective Retrieval Augmented Generation (CRAG), which involves retrieving documents, grading them for relevance, and generating answers if at least one document is relevant. If all documents are ambiguous or incorrect, it retrieves from an external source and uses that as context for answer generation. This process ensures a neat workflow where retrieval is done similarly to basic RAG, but with an added step of reasoning about the documents to ensure accurate and helpful responses.
