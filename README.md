# FreeStream

Providing AI solutions for everyday people

***TLDR***:
- Offers AI tooling like a general-purpose chatbot assistant
- Provides free access to generative AI models
- Accepts unlimited file uploads (per user session; deletes data upon exit)
- Leverages state-of-the-art RAG techniques for accurate, helpful responses without requiring complex prompt engineering
- Protects privacy ‚Äì no AI model training on your data, no sign-up needed

## Quickstart

This app is hosted via Streamlit Community Cloud, [here](https://freestream.streamlit.app/ "Current Version: 3.0.0")

### Installation

This project uses `poetry` for dependency management because that's what Streamlit Community Cloud uses to deploy the project.

Install it with:
```bash
pip install -U pip && pip install -U poetry
```

Then, install the project's dependencies in a virtual environment using poetry. 

Run:

```bash
poetry install
```

You will need to set all required secrets, which require their own respective accounts.
Make a copy of "template.secrets.toml" and rename it to "secrets.toml" in the root of the project. Fill out each field in the file.

You can then start the development server with hot reloading by running:

```bash
poetry run streamlit run ./freestream/üè°_Home.py
```

## Description
I originally created this project as a chatbot for law and medical professionals, but I quickly realized a more flexible system would benefit everyone.

| Self-RAG | Self-reflective Retrieval Augmented Generation |

### What can FreeStream do for me, currently?

FreeStream functions as a chatbot powered by GPT-3.5-Turbo or Gemini-Pro. Upload a file (or files) and take advantage of advanced prompt engineering for the most helpful results based on your uploaded content.

**Note**:
* The implemented RAG logic strictly adheres to the uploaded context. This limits meaningful interaction with the chat history.

## Functional Requirements

The application **MUST**...
1. Provide a user interface for chatbot interactions and optional file uploads.
2. Allow users to upscale images (PDF, JPEG, PNG, ~~BMP~~, ~~SVG~~) without limits.
3. ~~Enable users to remove objects from uploaded images. This requires:~~
    * ~~Object detection~~
    * ~~Object removal~~
    * ~~Inpainting~~
      * ~~[HuggingFace Resource](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/en/using-diffusers/inpaint)~~
      * ~~[HF Mask Maker (Space)](https://huggingface.co/spaces/daethyra/inpaint-mask-maker)~~
4. Let users generate tasks based on their speech
5. Include a privacy policy that clearly outlines data usage when interacting with GPT-3.5 or Gemini-Pro
6. ~~Provide a "Submit Report/Request" form~~

## "Non-Functional Requirements

The application **SHOULD**...
1. Aim for 24/7 availability.
2. Use a multipage Streamlit application structure.
3. Prioritize ease of navigation
4. Feature a visually appealing design.
5. Position itself as a toolbox for niche professional workflows.
6. Offer multiple chat models

# Roadmap

## Thinking Out Loud
I'm focusing on overhauling the retrieval prompting logic. I'll remove `ConversationalRetrievalChain` because it restricts flexibility and nuanced answers. I'll either adopt `AgentExecutor` or implement LangGraph for greater control over AI decision-making, hopefully improving response quality.

## Future Functionality Plans

- [x] Create an RAG chatbot
- [x] Add Gemini-Pro to the model list
- [ ] ~~Integrate [`StreamlitCallbackHandler`](https://api.python.langchain.com/en/latest/callbacks/langchain_community.callbacks.streamlit.streamlit_callback_handler.StreamlitCallbackHandler.html "Python API Documentation")~~
- [ ] Add AI decision making
  - [ ] Implement Corrective-RAG OR Reflective-RAG
- [x] Turn into a Multi-Page Application (MPA)
  - [x] (Homepage) Add a welcome screen with...
    - [x] a description of the project
    - [ ] ~~table of contents~~
    - [x] privacy policy
    - [ ] ~~"Report/Request" form~~
  - [x] (Page) Migrate RAG SPA code
    - [x] Add "Temperature" slider
  - [ ] (Page) Add a "Task Transcriber"
    - [ ] Microphone input (Record in browser)
    - [ ] Transcribes audio to text
    - [ ] Use LLM to identify each and every task while grouping some to avoid redundance
    - [ ] Generates text within a predefined task template, for each task identified
  - [x] (Page) Add "Image Upscaler"
    - [x] Multi-file upload
    - [x] File type detection
  - [ ] (Page) Add "Object Removal" from images
    - [x] Review HuggingFace Spaces's as a potential solution
- [ ] Add "Contributing" section or file
